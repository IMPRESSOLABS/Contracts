# Welcome to IMPRESSO Solidity Contract Audit

Welcome to the IMPRESSO Solidity Contract repository! We are excited to have you here and encourage you to audit our smart contracts to ensure their security and reliability. This repository contains the compiled Solidity smart contracts for [Your Project Name], which are open for public review.

## Project Overview

[Your Project Name] is a [brief description of your project – e.g., decentralized finance protocol, NFT marketplace, etc.]. Our goal is to [explain the purpose or vision of your project].

The smart contracts in this repository are integral to the [Your Project Name] ecosystem and handle [briefly describe the functionality – e.g., transactions, token management, etc.].

## Contract Details

### Compiled Contracts

The repository includes the compiled bytecode and ABI of the Solidity contracts. These are generated from the following Solidity files:

- `Impresso.sol`: [Base ECR20 smart contract]
- `ImpressoAC.sol`: [ECR20 smart contract with Access Control]
- `ImpressoVotable.sol`: [Voteable ECR20 smart contract]
- `ImpressoVotableAC.sol`: [Voteable ECR20 smart contract with Access Control]
- `UUPSProxy.sol`: [UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) is one of the standards for creating upgradeable smart contracts]

### Contract Addresses

- **MOCA**: [Address on mainnet/testnet]
- **ESSO**: [Address on mainnet/testnet]
- **BREW**: [Address on mainnet/testnet]

## How to Audit

We welcome audits from security researchers, developers, and the general public. To audit our contracts, follow these steps:

1. **Review the Code**: Examine the Solidity source files and compiled bytecode.
2. **Test the Contracts**: Deploy the contracts to a test network (e.g., Rinkeby, Ropsten) and interact with them using a tool like Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle.
3. **Check for Vulnerabilities**: Look for common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, integer overflow/underflow, and others.
4. **Review Gas Costs**: Analyze the gas usage to ensure the contracts are optimized.
5. **Report Findings**: Submit your findings and suggestions through [your preferred method – e.g., GitHub Issues, email, etc.].
